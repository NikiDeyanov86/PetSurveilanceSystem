# PetSurveilanceSystem

It is basically an embedded system based on the Raspberry Pi 4 and Python Flask. The system is
placed on a 4X4 driven car-like robot platform and enables a pet owner to remotely watch and
entertain his pet through a web app when it is home alone. The system also has the ability to
follow the pet using an object tracking algorithm.
